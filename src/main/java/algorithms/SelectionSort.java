/**
 * In computer science, selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(n2) time complexity,
 * which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. Selection
 * sort is noted for its simplicity and has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain
 * situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.
 * <p>
 * The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to
 * right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the
 * list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm
 * proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist,
 * exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist
 * boundaries one element to the right.
 * <p>
 * The time efficiency of selection sort is quadratic, so there are a number of sorting techniques which have better
 * time complexity than selection sort. One thing which distinguishes selection sort from other sorting algorithms is
 * that it makes the minimum possible number of swaps, n âˆ’ 1 in the worst case.
